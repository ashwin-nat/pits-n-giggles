        TEST CASE EXPLANATION
        ========================================================================

        This test case validates the FuelRateRecommender class under realistic race conditions
        with safety car periods. The test simulates a 20-lap race with two safety car periods
        and verifies that the recommender correctly handles the different fuel consumption rates
        between racing and safety car conditions.

        Test Setup:
        - 20-lap race with minimum required fuel of 3kg at finish
        - Starting with 60kg of fuel
        - Two safety car periods: laps 5-7 and laps 12-14 (total of 6 safety car laps)
        - Fuel consumption rates:
        * Racing: 2.8 kg/lap
        * Safety Car: 1.2 kg/lap (lower due to reduced speed)

        Expected Behavior:
        - The recommender should correctly calculate the current fuel rate and surplus laps.
        - The target next lap fuel usage should be adjusted based on the difference between
          current and target rates.
        - The recommender should correctly handle the different fuel consumption rates between
          racing and safety car conditions.
        - The recommender should correctly calculate the safety car fuel rate.
        - The recommender should correctly calculate the fuel used in the last lap.
