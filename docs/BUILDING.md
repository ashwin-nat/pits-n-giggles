# 🛠 Building pits-n-giggles with PyInstaller

This document outlines the steps to build the `pits-n-giggles` app into an executable using PyInstaller.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.12 installed and available in your `PATH`
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) for creating executables

## 📝 Installation Steps

1. **Install dependencies and PyInstaller** (excluding the `dev` group):

   ```bash
   poetry install --without dev
   ```

   This installs all the production dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.

## 🏗 Building the Executable

1. **Run PyInstaller**:

   Once all dependencies are installed, use the following command to build the executable:

   ```bash
   poetry run pyinstaller --clean scripts/png.spec
   ```

   This command needs to be executed from the root of the project directory.

2. **Check the `dist/` Folder**:

   After running PyInstaller, the executable will be available in the `dist/` directory, typically located in the root of the project.

## ❗ Notes

- Ensure that your virtual environment is activated when running these commands.
- The `dev` dependencies (such as testing tools) are not required for the build process and should be excluded.
- If you need to customize the PyInstaller build process, modify the `png.spec` file.

## 🔄 Cleaning Up

If you want to clean up the build files generated by PyInstaller, you can delete the `build/` and `dist/` directories manually or use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pyinstaller --clean script/png.spec
```
