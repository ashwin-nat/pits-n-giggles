    # ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:

    # 1. Data Storage:
    # - Maintains history of fuel readings with lap number, fuel remaining, and lap type

    # 2. Fuel Rate Calculation:
    # - Groups racing laps into consecutive segments to handle safety car interruptions
    # - Calculates fuel usage within each segment separately
    # - Derives overall rate from total fuel used across segments divided by racing lap count

    # 3. Target Calculation:
    # - Computes target fuel rate to finish with minimum required fuel
    # - Determines surplus/deficit laps based on current consumption
    # - Calculates adaptive target for next lap

    # 4. Prediction:
    # - Projects final fuel level using current racing fuel rate
    # - Assumes all remaining laps are racing laps

    # 5. Recomputation:
    # - Refreshes all calculations when new data is added
    # - Sequence: last lap usage → racing rate → current state → targets → predictions
