## 🧑‍💻 Making Changes

- All development work happens off the `dev` branch.
- To make a change:
  1. Create a new **feature branch** from `dev`.
  2. Make small, incremental commits with clear messages.
  3. Follow existing naming and code style conventions.
  4. Test your changes before committing.

- For documentation related changes, make a PR from the main branch

## 📦 Submitting Pull Requests

1. Push your feature branch and open a **PR into `dev`**.
   - This PR will be **fully reviewed** before merge.
   - In the PR description, explain:
     - What you changed
     - Why you changed it
     - Any relevant screenshots or logs

---

## 📝 Style & Formatting

- Use consistent naming, spacing, and docstrings.
- Keep UI changes minimal unless the change is meant to be visual.
- Try to write clean, readable code — comments are welcome!
